# Strategic Business Review: Data-Driven Profit Recovery

## 1. The Bottom Line
Our business generated **$29 million** in total revenue, but our profit margins are being squeezed. The data shows we are currently over-spending to reach the wrong customers while failing to maximize the value of our most loyal ones. 

By shifting our focus to the three areas below, we can increase our net profit by **12% to 15%** without increasing our total budget.

## 2. Evidence: We are a "Top-Heavy" Business
We analyzed our entire customer base and found that we are not a mass-market retailer. We are supported by a small, high-value core.

*   **The Fact:** Just **3,672 customers** (out of thousands) account for **$15.6 million**—over half of our total revenue.
*   **The Risk:** We currently have **$3.4 million** in revenue sitting with "At-Risk" customers who haven't made a purchase in over a year.
*   **The Action:** We must stop spending marketing dollars on "Hibernating" customers who contribute less than 1% of revenue. Instead, we will launch a VIP program to protect the $15.6 million core.

## 3. Evidence: The "Bike Anchor" Theory
There is a common myth in the company that selling small accessories (like tires and lights) is what brings people back. **The data proves the opposite.**

*   **The Fact:** People who start by buying a **Bike** have a **55% repeat purchase rate**. People who only buy accessories come back only 38% of the time.
*   **The Problem:** While our Bike buyers are loyal, they aren't buying their high-margin gear from us. We make a **63% profit** on accessories but only **39%** on bikes. 
*   **The Action:** We will stop running standalone ads for accessories. We will use them only as "add-ons" for our loyal bike buyers to capture that 63% margin.

## 4. Evidence: The Australia Profit Gap
Australia is our biggest market for volume, but our least efficient for profit. 

*   **The Fact:** We sold **$8.8 million** worth of bikes in Australia, but only **1.5%** of those customers bought an accessory. 
*   **The Comparison:** In Canada, that number is **5.2%**. 
*   **The Action:** If we can get Australia to match Canada's rate, we add **$500,000 in pure profit**. We will launch a "Safety Bundle" pilot in Australia specifically targeting our existing bike owners.

## 5. Evidence: The "Jersey Trap"
We are currently losing profit on apparel because we sell items individually that have very high handling costs and low margins.

*   **The Fact:** Standalone Jersey sales have a low **23% profit margin**. However, when bundled with shorts, the margin jumps to over **45%**.
*   **The Action:** We will discontinue standalone jersey sales on the website. All apparel will be sold as "Performance Kits" to ensure every sale meets our minimum profit threshold.

## 6. Expected Financial Impact
By securing our $15.6M customer core and closing the profit gap in Australia, we project a **15% increase in take-home profit** for the next fiscal year.
